## How I became a better programmer
https://jlongster.com/How-I-Became-Better-Programmer

**General**
* Find people who inspire you, but don't idolize them
* Don't devalue your work.
* Don't feel pressured to work all the time.
* Ignore fluff.
* Dig into past research.
* Take on big projects. Get uncomfortable.

**Programming**
* Learn C
* Write a compiler
* Learn macros - See Scheme, Lisp, or Clojure(Script). Macros will really change  how you see code
* SICP
* Understand continuations
* If anything, just try a new language (Clojure, Rust, Elm, OCaml/Reason, Go, or Scheme)
