Building, signing + distribution

Chris

How signing works
Automatic vs manual

Different countries

Based on privileges to signing

Xcode server,

PP - entitlement, (make use)
PP - signed by apple - access -


Dev - a , dev - b - PP

Some entitles like write to driver - manual
Preference - to use automatic

Adding devs to Apple account - That’s how it is supposed to work
Contractors do have the certificate in case of fastlane


Create - template debug and release


Past WWDC:
What’s new Xcode and Xcode server
Sign and resign the dev and distribution
