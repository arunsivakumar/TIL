SB vs XIB
Preference

Static vs dynamic messages
Import and export string

Table view is performant
Self sizing cells - full auto layout
Height - content


Still recycles -

Swift ui - UIkit

Breaking constant - no performance , but which is drawn
Breakpoint set and build

Collection view - inside table - no self sizing
Override intrinsic contentment size be careful

Setneedsdsdiplay - layers Manuel overriding - customer views
Layouts - set need update constrains - resize text files

Table view being updates and end updates - a bunch of changes at the same time
Update rows -  

Build localization friendly auto layout
